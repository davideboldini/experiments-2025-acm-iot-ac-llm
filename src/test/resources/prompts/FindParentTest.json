    "generate a scala function (ONLY THE FUNCTION!!) called findParent that aims to find a \"parent\" node within a network of devices. It achieves this by considering a value called \"potential\" associated with each device. The basic idea is to have each device try to find the neighbor with the lowest potential.\n\nThe function begins by figuring out, for each device, what the lowest potential is within its immediate neighborhood, along with the ID of the device holding that minimal potential value.\n\nThen, a crucial step occurs where each device checks its own potential against this minimal potential found in the neighborhood. If the device’s own potential is greater than this minimal neighboring potential, it means there's a neighbor with a more \"attractive\" potential. In that case, it returns the ID of this better neighboring device as its parent. However, if the device already possesses the lowest potential (or if its potential is not bigger than its lowest neighbor), it will not assign another parent by returning a placeholder large number as parent id, essentially indicating that no new parent is needed at the moment.\n\nEssentially, this findParent function is trying to establish a hierarchy across nodes based on a \"potential\" value. Nodes look for neighbors with a lower potential than theirs. If such a neighbor exists, it becomes the node's parent, thus moving a device toward areas with better or low-valued “potentials”."
