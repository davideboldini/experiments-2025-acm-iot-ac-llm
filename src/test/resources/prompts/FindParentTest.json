    "Generate a Scala function (ONLY!!!!!!) using aggregate computing constructs that find a node's parent based on a potential value. The function should be named findParent, take a Double potential as input, and return an ID. Use nbr to get neighbor's potential and mid() in a tuple. Use minHood to find the minimum potential and associated mid(). Use mux to return the mid of the node with the minimum potential if it's lower than the node's potential or Int.MaxValue otherwise."
