**Gradient Cast with Obstacle Avoidance:**

The `G` function can be used for pathfinding and obstacle avoidance.  When calculating the `metric`, instead of directly using `nbrRange()`, a conditional check on obstacle presence can influence the distance calculation. If an obstacle is detected, the metric should return a very large value (approaching infinity) to discourage pathfinding through that neighbor.  This effectively creates a "cost" for traversing through an obstacle.  It is important to use `Double.PositiveInfinity` and not `Double.MaxValue` as the latter is a finite value that might still be chosen by the algorithm.

**Collect Cast for Path Confirmation:**

The `C` function can be used to confirm path existence. By setting the `local` value to the source condition and using a boolean OR (`_ || _`) as the accumulator, `C` can propagate a "success" signal back from the destination if a valid path exists. The `potential` for `C` should be the result of the obstacle-avoiding `G` calculation.  The `Null` value for the accumulator should be `false`. The result of `C` will be `true` at the source if a path to the destination exists, avoiding the obstacles.
